// Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
// v8 Engine is a comiler that takes JS code and turns it into machine code


// node has file system manipulation
// while browser manipulates whats shown inside the window

// in browser:
  // window--> global object that stores everything you have access to
// on node:
  // global not window because its not a browser

// in browser:
  // document --> references the DOM up above in the browser (HTML, CSS, etc.)
// on node:
  // process same thing as document on browser
